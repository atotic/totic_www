<H4>The early years</H4>

<P>Born in Belgrade, <A HREF="http://www.titoville.com/">Yugoslavia,</A> where 
  I lived for 15 years (Konjarnik). Finished high school at <A HREF="http://www.neskt.com/">New 
  English School</A> in Kuwait, could not go back to Yugoslavia, so at the age 
  of 17 I came to US. After landing in upstate New York by accident (I've thought 
  that I was going to a suburb of NYC), I quickly backpedalled to Boston, where 
  I got my degree from Boston College. After an interesting few years of delivering 
  pizza, packages, temping, working for a strange startup, I decided that I'd 
  like to do something more with my life. GRE later, I got accepted to <A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu/">UofI</A>, 
  Urbana-Champaign. While working to pay for the grad school in the basement of 
  <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</A>, I've decided that I prefer writing 
  code to writing papers. At this time, very few places besides CERN had a home 
  page. For a while, I had lot of fun with Mosaic, and then I followed <A HREF="andreessen_a.gif">our 
  fearless leader</A> to California. The move was promptly commemorated on our 
  <A HREF="board2.jpg">whiteboard</A>. Then the real life started at warp speed.</P>

<H4>Life</H4>

<P>Oh, life, I am working much less so there is more of it.Windsurfing, <A HREF="http://people.netscape.com/matt/realpac/temple.html">skiing</A>, 
  oasis in Palo Alto, pad in San Fransisco. Of course, none of this would be worth 
  much without friends to enjoy it with:</P>

- Mr. Neck Beard and roomate to be, jevering, and rest of the knobs.</P>

<P>Other hobbies? Not many, life is busy. Since I hate cars, got a motorbike, 
  my friends are betting on my life expectancy. Trying to read, quitting smoking. 
  And the usual passtimes of overworked engineers: <A HREF="nohair/nohair.html">The 
  No Hair Club For Men</A>, <a href="swirl/swirl.html">The Swirl Society of Netscape</a>.</P>



<P>A friend of mine, Sarah, started a company, <A HREF="http://www.sixredmarbles.com/">Six Red Marbles</A>, and

I've helped out a bit.</P>

<H4>Work</H4>

<P>You really do not want to read about my work. You've read all about it already: Netscape, &quot;All Praise The

Company&quot;. At least, that was what we used to say in the early days. The early years that produced the BLINK

tag are a great story, better told over a beer. jwz has a great diary, <A HREF="http://people.netscape.com/jwz/gruntle/nscpdorm.html">NSCP

dorm</A>. I am happy to have lived to tell about it. I've worked on Mac browsers for a long time, and burned out

around January 1996. Now I am happily coding cross-platform code, SmartUpdate was a training exercise. It shipped,

used our own dogfood (Java, JavaScript, Security Framework). Roaming was the next big thing, right now I am contemplating

retirement, and working on building the foundations</P>

<P><BR>
  Tim Berners-Lee on home page:<BR>
  <I>Q. The idea of the &quot;home page&quot; evolved in a different dir</I><i>ection. 
  <br>
  </i><br>
  A. Yes. With all respect, the personal home page is not a private expression; 
  it's a public billboard that people work on to say what they're interested in. 
  That's not as interesting to me as people using it in their private lives. It's 
  exhibitionism, if you like. Or self-expression. It's openness, and it's great 
  in a way, it's people letting the community into their homes. But it's not really 
  their home. They may call it a home page, but it's more like the<b> gnome in 
  somebody's front yard</b> than the home itself. People don't have the tools 
  for using the Web for their homes, or for organizing their private lives; they 
  don't really put their scrapbooks on the Web. They don't have family Webs. There 
  are many distributed families nowadays, especially in the high-tech fields, 
  so it would be quite reasonable to do that, yet I don't know of any. One reason 
  is that most people don't have the ability to publish with restricted access.
