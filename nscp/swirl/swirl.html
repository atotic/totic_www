    <TD colSpan=3>This was the original swirl that started it all off. We were 
      playing "How Little Would It Take?" Lou offered Matt $100,000 to take a 
      swirl, it gradually got bid down by people who would take a swirl for less 
      money. Matt received $200 for this one (though he actually got a second 
      the same night without making any money on that one.) </TD></TR>

    <TD colSpan=3>This is me getting a swirl on my birthday. Someone had asked 
      what I wished for and in the true spirit of the game "Truth or Swirl" I 
      decided not to answer but instead "Take the Swirl." Originally, I had been 
      skeptical about it, but I found it to be very refreshing. </TD>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=3>Originally, we weren't going to allow interns to get 
      swirled. Ross just wanted to be loved so much that we found it hard to 
      deny him; though we now require that people have washed their feet 
      sometime in the last month before we will swirl them in the future. 
      <P>As Ross came back for a second internship, we are hoping to have a 
      second picture of Ross getting swirled up here soon. </P></TD>

    <TD colSpan=3>Getting swirled is so exciting that even people who don't 
      work at Netscape are starting to get into the action. In fact, Paul was so 
      impressed by his swirl, shown here, that soon after he quit his job and 
      came to work at Netscape. </TD>

      <CENTER>For his 30th birthday, Aleks decided he wanted to be on the 
      receiving end of a swirl:<BR><IMG 
      src="swirlaleks.jpg"><BR>You can see 
      Aleks on the <I>giving</I> end of a swirl up in Ross's picture; I'll let 
      Aleks comment as to whether its better to give than receive. This swirl 
      took place at our recent "Stupid Party" where everyone had to bring 
      something stupid to get in. You can see the yellow combination soap-bubble 
      / writing pen around Lou's neck and also a set of cheezy plastic rings on 
      Aleks' fingers. </CENTER></TD></TR>

      <P>History was made recently with the first ever recorded "chick swirl". 
      Having never attended a Channing Palace Party before, and so unaware of 
      just how stupid things could get, she foolishly agreed to be swirled for 
      the paltry sum of $500. <IMG 
      src="judd.jpg" align=right> When the 
      time came, she tried to renegotiate for more cash, but to no avail. It 
      took all of about 2 minutes to raise the necessary funds. 
      <P>Since April was such a good sport about getting swirled we immediately 
      swirled her husband Judd. He struggled a lot more than she did (since his 
      was for free) but he supplied the Netscape connection that got Apirl 
      introduced to the practice of swirling in the first place.

Thanks to everyone who has written in with their support of this page. If you 
have swirl pictures you want added or linked to pass them along. So far, I 
haven't received any swirl pictures from the outside world. I find this hard to 
believe that we are the only ones enjoying this activity.
