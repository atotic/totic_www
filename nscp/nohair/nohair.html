<H1 align=center>The No Hair Club For Men</H1>"Hello, my name is Lou Montulli, 
and I'm the founder of the <B>No Hair Club For Men</B>. For years young men like 
me have been frustrated by the long wait for eventual baldness. The admiration 
and respect given to bald men seemed just out of their reach. 
<P>Now, through moden hair-deforestation techniques, you can achieve the 
natural, bald-as-an-egg look in a few simple steps. 
<P>So call 1-800-SHAVEME right away and begin to enjoy all the benefits you've 
been missing. After all ... <BR clear=all>

  tell me about the <B>No Hair Club For Men</B>, but I wouldn't listen to them.

  about hair deforestation, so the <B>No Hair Club For Men</B> Transition Specialist 
  suggested wearing progressively smaller and smaller live animals on my head.
